I have an PC now, but it broken, Soo i need to troubleshooting that PC, i don't have a time for doing that, Soo i need to troubleshoot and maybe need to Save money to buy damaged components, maybe it take some time, but still progressing.

I went to my friend's house to do troubleshooting because our PCs were similar, and it turned out that the ~RAM, CPU and~ motherboard were damaged. Luckily the PSU, RAM, CPU and VGA Card can still be used normally, and I have to save to buy ~RAM, CPU and~ motherboard at the same time.

I'm currently busy preparing for my older brother's wedding, so I will stop coding for a while until the wedding is finished, maybe until the beginning of July, but Idk if it could be longer than I thought.

7. (dd/mm/yy)

I started to think, instead of buying a used product, and I don't know whether it will last long, or it will be damaged immediately, or maybe it is an item that is already damaged (because the guarantee has been lost many time ago), then I finally decided to buy all new products for the Motherboard, RAM and CPU. Because the PSU and VGA Card are still normal and can be used, maybe in the future I will upgrade them.

8. (dd/mm/yy)
(03/07/24)
Finally I have bought a motherboard, RAM and CPU thanks to the help of my mother and brother, I really love them

Finally i have bought a Monitor, my hard working is aleardy been paid off little by little, now my goal is saving for a GPU and PSU, for the Case, Gaming Chair, Fan, Camera, Mic, even Mousepad i think would be later far beyond after getting some good Pc Parts
